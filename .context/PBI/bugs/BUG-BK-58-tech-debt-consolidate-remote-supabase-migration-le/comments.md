## Root Cause Analysis

The remote `supabase*migrations.schema*migrations` ledger drifted from the repo's `supabase/migrations/` files — a process artifact, not a schema bug:

- ***3 ledger rows for one file (0014)***: during BK-10, each iteration of the in-flight `0014*module*soft*delete.sql` was applied via Supabase MCP `apply*migration`, which mints a new ledger row per call (`module*soft*delete`, `module*update*fn*param*defaults`, `module*update*fn*slug*guard`).
- ***Unprefixed rows***: `module*move`, `user*story*uniqueness`, `atc*create*update` lacked the repo `NNNN*` basename.
- ***Missing rows***: `0019*import*jobs` / `0020*import*jobs*one*active` existed remotely but had no ledger rows (applied outside `apply_migration`).

The remote schema itself always matched the repo end-state (verified live before repair) — drift was ledger metadata only.

## Fix Applied

Full ledger normalization in one DML transaction (scope ratified by Tech Lead):

| Action | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Deleted 2 amendment rows | `20260604224136`, `20260604225156` — SQL fully subsumed by final 0014 file |
| Normalized surviving 0014 row | name → `0014*module*soft_delete`, `statements` → final file content |
| Renamed 3 unprefixed rows | `0015*module*move`, `0016*user*story*uniqueness`, `0021*atc*create*update` |
| Backfilled 2 missing rows | `20260607000019` / `20260607000020` with file content (synthetic in-window versions) |

Convention + repair log documented in `supabase/migrations/README.md` (PR #35, merged to staging).

## Verification Performed

- Post-repair `list_migrations`: exactly 22 rows, 1:1 with repo files `0001`–`0022`, all named by file basename, chronological order intact.
- Zero schema impact: repair touched only `supabase*migrations.schema*migrations` metadata; no app code, no RLS, no functions.

## How to Verify

Compare the ledger against `supabase/migrations/` filenames (e.g. Supabase MCP `list*migrations` or a dashboard query on `supabase*migrations.schema_migrations`): every row name must equal a repo file basename, one row per file, 22/22.

**Fix ready for QA verification.**
