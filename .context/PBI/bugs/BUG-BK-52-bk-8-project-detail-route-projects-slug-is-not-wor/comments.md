## Root Cause Analysis

Four server-side sites resolved a project by slug only — `.from('projects').eq('slug', slug).limit(1)` with ***no workspace filter****: the project detail page, the ATC editor page, the new-ATC page, and the tree-view ATC detail action. The DB enforces slug uniqueness ****per workspace*** (`unique(workspace_id, slug)`), so a member of two workspaces can have 2+ rows for one slug; `.limit(1)` with no ordering returned an arbitrary row, and a slug existing only in WS2 resolved while WS1 was active. A code comment documented this as a knowingly deferred MVP shortcut that was never paid down after multi-workspace shipped.

## Fix Applied

- New pure helper `lib/workspaces/active.ts`: `resolveActiveWorkspaceId(cookieValue, visibleWorkspaceIds)` — the cookie's workspace when visible, else the first visible, else null.
- All four resolution sites now filter `.eq('workspace_id', activeWorkspaceId)`; when resolution is impossible they 404 (pages) / return null (action), per each site's existing contract.
- The three pre-existing inline copies of this resolution (app layout, projects list, `/api/v1/me`) were consolidated onto the helper — behavior-preserving.
- Ratified scope decision: URL shape stays `/projects/{slug}` scoped to the ***active workspace***; canonical workspace-scoped URLs (`/workspaces/{ws}/projects/{slug}`, AC step 9 wording) deferred as a future ADR candidate.

PR #36 (merged to staging, deploy verified).

## Verification Performed

- Unit: `lib/workspaces/active.test.ts` (cookie-visible / stale-cookie fallback / null cookie / empty list → null / first-element fallback). Full suite 227/227 green.
- Staging smoke: `/projects/smoke-checkout` resolves HTTP 200 under its owning active workspace; `/api/v1/me` returns the correct `active*workspace*id` after the helper consolidation.

## How to Verify

With membership in two workspaces and a project slug present only in workspace B: while workspace A is active, `/projects/{that-slug}` must 404; after switching to workspace B it must resolve. Two same-named projects (same slug) in both workspaces must each show their own content per the active workspace — breadcrumb workspace name must always match the active one.

**Fix ready for QA verification.**
