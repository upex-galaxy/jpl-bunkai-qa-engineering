## Root Cause Analysis

The three SECURITY DEFINER module-mutation RPCs (`bunkai*update*module`, `bunkai*archive*module*subtree` — 0014; `bunkai*move*module` — 0015) contained no `activity*log` insert, so module rename/move/soft-delete left no audit trail. The route layer cannot compensate: `activity_log` deliberately has no client INSERT policy (0009), and the modules route uses a user-scoped client on both auth paths. The only sanctioned write path is an in-function DEFINER insert — the precedent established by 0021 for ATC events.

## Fix Applied

Migration `0023*module*activity_log.sql` (applied to the remote project and mirrored in the repo) re-creates the three functions with one audit insert each, atomic with the mutation (single plpgsql transaction — denied/failed calls roll the audit row back):

| Action | Payload |
| --- | --- |
| `module.renamed` | `{name, old*path, new*path}` |
| `module.description_updated` | `{}` (no content leak) |
| `module.moved` | `{old*path, new*path, old*parent*id, new*parent*id}` |
| `module.archived` | the per-table archived counts the RPC returns |

- `entity*type` = `module`, `entity*id` = module id, `workspace_id` = owning workspace, actor = `auth.uid()` (user-scoped client on both auth paths; role-gate guarantees non-null on success).
- No-op paths (same-parent move, already-archived subtree) emit nothing.
- Function signatures unchanged (no typegen); bodies otherwise identical to 0014/0015 (review-verified).
- Scope note: module CREATE is intentionally not audited — it is a direct RLS table insert, not an RPC; auditing it would require converting the create path (follow-up candidate, out of this bug's title scope).
- Taxonomy documented in `.context/business/events.md` (Module events section).

PR #37 (merged to staging, deploy verified). Sequencing: applied on the freshly normalized ledger (BK-58), so the `0023*module*activity_log` row landed clean.

## Verification Performed

- Staging smoke via the live API (user-scoped path): rename round-trip on the smoke workspace module produced exactly two `module.renamed` rows with non-null actor and correct `{name, old*path, new*path}` payloads (`payments` → `payments-smoke` → `payments`); module restored to its original state — the only residue is the genuine audit evidence of the smoke itself.
- Combined-PATCH rejection (BK-57) confirmed no audit row is written when the request is rejected.

## How to Verify

Rename, move, or soft-delete a module, then read the workspace's `activity_log` (workspace members have SELECT via RLS): one row per mutation with the payloads above; repeated no-ops (same-parent move, re-archive) add no rows.

**Fix ready for QA verification.**
