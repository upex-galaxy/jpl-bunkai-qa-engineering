## Overview

***Source spec:*** BK-027

## User story

***As a*** QA Lead
***I want to*** view a defect heatmap showing defect count and week-over-week trend per module over a chosen window
***So that*** I can see at a glance where quality is degrading without reading through every defect

## Definition of done

- [ ] A heatmap shows one cell per module with its defect count over the chosen window
- [ ] Each cell shows a week-over-week trend indicator (rising, falling or flat)
- [ ] The window can be chosen (for example the last 30 days)
- [ ] Modules with more defects are visually emphasized so hotspots stand out
- [ ] A freshly filed defect appears in the heatmap promptly
- [ ] Modules with zero defects in the window are clearly distinguishable from hotspots
- [ ] The module path is shown so the Lead can tell nested modules apart
